So it's really tough to stop work and go to bed when you have more than 10 critical issues flagged by CodeRabbit because of horrendous code quality.

UPDATE 1 - December 10, 2025 | 11:36 PM

The issues still aren't fixed, I really want to get this finished by today.

UPDATE 2 - December 10, 2025 | 11:40 PM

I have decided that I will continue fixing these issues tomorrow. It's really satisfying to see so many collapsed issues with "Resolved", but I still need to do some more bug fixing in the PR.
