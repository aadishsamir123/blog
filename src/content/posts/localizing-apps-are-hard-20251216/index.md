Hi guys, so it's been really long since my last blog since I was pretty busy. The past few days, I've been trying to add localization support to ShopSync and making python scripts and stuff to automatically extract strings are really tough(regex is another pain).

Anyway I feel that I'm almost done and can soon finally merge the [pull request](https://github.com/ASDev-Official/shopsync/pull/167).
